1. To use the weka API you need to install Weka 3.9.5 according to your operating system
2. After downloading the archive and extracting it you’ll find the weka.jar file. The JAR file contains all the class files required i.e. weka API
3. You need to add this jar as a classpath to JDK. 

I use Eclipse IDE for Java Developers - 2021-09.

In Eclipse:
1. Create a new java project as WRD_Project and a new java class as WRD_Ensemble_Class
2. Right-click on your project in the Package Explorer
3. select "Build Path" → "Configure Build Path". In the "Libraries" tab click on the "Class Path", then click on the "Add External JARs" button and finally select weka.jar file
4. Now copy the code provided in WRD_Ensemble_CKD_Code file to run it.
